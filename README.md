App + middleware + http server using the [Cob Spec](https://github.com/8thlight/cob_spec) test suite from 8th Light for feedback to learn Clojure as I read the [Joy of Clojure](https://www.manning.com/books/the-joy-of-clojure-second-edition). 

Been reading the source code from Ring and Compojure as well, though it does not use these libraries (yet).
